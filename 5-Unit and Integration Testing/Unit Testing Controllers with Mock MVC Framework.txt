What is MockMvc?

	You mock your service, for example you need to mock your localhost:8080/students
	MockMvc helps you to do that, instead of running your controller you run mockMvc.

What is @WebMvcTest?

	It is an annotation  that you define that you are writing an 
	WebMvcTest and witch controller are we using for example
	@WebMvcTest(value = SurveyController.class, secure = false)

What is @MockBean?

	To create a mock of our service/beans and return data that we want.

How do you write a unit test with MockMVC?

	You need to mock our returned data
	and then we need to define that when our service.method is called
	then return our mocked data.
	
	Then we need to build a request for example:
	
	RequsestBuilder requestBuilder = MockMvcRequestBuilders.get("/surveys/Survey1/questions/Question1").accept(
	MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
	
	And after that we need to execute the request:
	
	MvcResult result = mockMvc.perform(requestBuilder).andReturn();
	
	String expected = "{id:Question1, description:Largest Country in the World}"
	
	JSONAssert.assertEquals(expected, result.getResponse().getContentAsString(),false);
	
	//assert

What is JSONAssert?

	It makes it easy to assert jsons, it removes some spacing etc....
